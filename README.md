# Quantum Music Composer  

**Quantum Music Composer** is an open-source project that explores the intersection of **quantum-inspired algorithms**, **Peruvian huayno rhythms**, and **jazz harmony**.  
It generates melodies using a **quantum-inspired random walk**, applies **Andean pentatonic scales** and **huayno rhythmic structures**, and harmonizes them with **ii–V–I jazz progressions**.  
The system outputs **MIDI files**, ready to be used in digital audio workstations (DAWs) or notation software.
